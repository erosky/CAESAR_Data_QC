# Identify the time offset between the PICARRO data and VICSEL

# First, find time segment out of cloud
# Plot the three curves with original timestamps

# Perform the time shift operation

# Plot the new curves 
# summarize the results in a text document

"""  You can for instance create the spline easily with interpolate.UnivariateSpline() (from SciPy). SciPy returns a function, which is then easily fitted with optimize.leastsq(). """
